# Next Generation Clock – Transparent Gear Mechanism

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Next Generation Clock** is a fully functional, motor-powered, see-through clock designed to visually demonstrate how gears interact to keep time.  
Built as part of **BE 1200: Basic Engineering I – Final Project**, the clock features 3D-printed components and transparent barriers, allowing viewers to observe the internal gear movement in real time.  
Our goal was to help people better understand how traditional clocks work by making gear movement both visible and engaging.

## 🔍 My Role in the Project
- Contributed to **mechanical design** and **gear ratio calculations**
- Participated in **CAD modeling** and **3D printing** of custom parts
- Assembled the mechanical components, ensuring smooth gear motion
- Assisted with **testing** and **troubleshooting** motor-driven gear mechanisms

## ⚙️ Technical Approach
- **Drive Mechanism:** Powered by a 60 RPM DC motor
- **Gear Reduction Path:**
  1. Reduce from 60 RPM to 1 RPM using a 60:1 gear ratio
  2. Convert seconds to minutes using additional gear stages
  3. Convert minutes to hours for the hour hand movement
- **Materials:** PLA filament for 3D printing, acrylic panels for transparency, metal shafts/bearings for durability
- **Fabrication Process:**
  - Designed all parts in CAD software
  - 3D-printed the components
  - Assembled using threaded rods, bearings, and precision alignment

## 📊 Results
- Built a **fully functional transparent clock** where viewers can see every stage of gear movement
- Achieved precise gear ratios to match real-time clock operation
- Successfully integrated a motor for continuous operation
